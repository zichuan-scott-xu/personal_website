blurb: "Useful resources for transforming to a Typst experience."

Below is an updating list of useful sources I found while switching my note-writing experiences 
from LaTeX to [typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), a new markup-based type-setting system that 
use easier syntactic sugars. It might be helpful if you are tired of typing backslashes and ``\backslash``es.

### Templates
- The go-to template (and my favorite template) for writing a note. It also supports changing the "depth" of theorem numbering just by a single parameter pass, which I think is used quite often in writing math notes: [typst-theorems](https://github.com/sahasatvik/typst-theorems)
- The official template directory, good for publications: [typst/templates](https://github.com/typst/templates)

### Features
- Drawing: [typst-canvas](https://github.com/johannes-wolf/typst-canvas/tree/master)
- Commutative diagrams (Apr 2023): [typst-cd](https://gitlab.com/giacomogallina/typst-cd)
- Customizable table: [typst-tablex](https://github.com/PgBiel/typst-tablex/)
