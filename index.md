I am Scott Xu, a Software Engineer at Meta ðŸ›¸. I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford University ðŸŒ². My interests range from applying AI models for social advancements, cool computer graphics in game developments, and the wildness and beauty of mathematics.

Previously, I interned at IMC Trading as a quantitative researcher in Summer 2023 and Google in Summer 2022. I was an undergraduate researcher at <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">Stanford's SNAP group</a> in the CURIS Program, 2021.
