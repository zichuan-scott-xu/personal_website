I am Scott Xu, an undergraduate and master student majoring in Math and Computer Science at Stanford University. My interests range from creating cool apps, applying AI models for social advancements, computer graphics in games, and algebraic number theory to be learned.

I will intern at IMC Trading as a quantitative researcher in Summer 2023. I previously interned at Google in Summer 2022 and <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">Stanford's SNAP group</a> in 2021.
