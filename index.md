  I am Scott Xu, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Stanford University. My interests 
  range from creating cool apps, applying AI for social good, computer graphics, algebraic number theory... and more!

  I will intern at Google as a software engineer in Summer 2022. I was previously an undergraduate research intern at <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">Stanford's SNAP group</a>.
