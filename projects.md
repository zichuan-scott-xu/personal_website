title: Work
intro: Below are some of my coursework at Stanford and technical projects elsewhere. Having immersed myself (too much) in the campus life, I always hope to build some more crazy stuffs but have not yet turned some of my crazy ideas into real implementations. But I am grateful for this moment of life, wandering around and being troubled by how fast the technology is changing and how foolish and hungry I am. Maybe it's time to start on something new.

## Courses
Personal feelings towards some of the recent courses that I took and would recommend, by no means accurate descriptions of the material.

## Spring 2023
- **CS 144: Introduction to Computer Networking**. Great system class that dissemble the Internet into pieces.
- **CS 155: Computer and Network Security**. (Disclaimer: only done on a VM.)
- **STATS 315B: Modern Applied Statistics: Learning II**. A refresher on ML methods.
- **MATH 237A: Topics in Financial Math: Market microstructure and trading algorithms**. Final project in development on pairs trading with ML.

## Winter 2023
- **CS 228: Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques**. A deep dive into learning and infering distributions using PGMs that completely brushes my mind on Bayseian learning methods.
- **CS 238: Decision Making under Uncertainty**. Taking the class while learning basic Go from my friends.
- **MATH 238: Mathematical Finance**. Pricing models built on SDE.

## Fall 2022
- **CS 149: Parallel Computing**. After the tortures of learning to parallelize almost everything, one would become more skeptical and itchy about every line of code that runs happily on a single thread.
- **STATS 305A: Applied Statistics**. Statistical testing and procedures taught in a formal way with, surprisingly harder, more than 1 dimension. Many cool observations are distributed throughout the problem sets and coding projects.
- **Math 215A: Algebraic Topology**. Fundamental groups, homologies, and cohomologies of real and imagined shapes.

## My Younger Self
- **AI intro classes: CS224N, CS231N, CS246**. In these classes with big names, I got to implement a question-answering model and an image aesthetics scoring model. Good (but not enough) take on NLP and CV. CS246 (Mining Massive Data Sets) was a great class to dip into a compilation of data mining methods, from recommending systems to page ranks to GNNs.
- **CS Theory classes**: CS154 (Introduction to the Theory of Computation), CS166 (Data Structures).
- **Math classes to chew**: Math 122 (Modules and Group Representations), Math 154 (Algebraic Number Theory), Math 205A (Real analysis).
